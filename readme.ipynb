    "# Automobile Insurance Claim Cost Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to predict automobile insurance claim costs using machine learning models, with a focus on actuarial relevance and robustness to high-severity claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "Insurance claim costs are highly skewed, with rare but expensive claims having a major financial impact.  \n",
    "This project applies and compares several regression models to predict the total claim cost (`charge_totale`) and selects the most suitable model based on performance and business criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "- Source: Kaggle – Automobile Insurance Dataset  \n",
    "- Number of observations: ~47,500  \n",
    "- Target variable: `charge_totale`  \n",
    "- Features: driver characteristics, vehicle information, exposure, and past claims\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "The project follows a complete machine learning workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, train/test split)\n",
    "- Model training and comparison\n",
    "- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation\n",
    "- Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²\n",
    "- Overfitting and underfitting analysis using learning curves\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Models Evaluated\n",
    "- Linear Regression (baseline)\n",
    "- Support Vector Regression (SVR)\n",
    "- Random Forest\n",
    "- XGBoost (baseline and tuned)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model was selected based on its ability to control large prediction errors, which is critical in insurance applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "While Random Forest achieved the lowest MAE, the tuned XGBoost model obtained the best RMSE and R².  \n",
    "Since large errors are particularly costly in insurance, **XGBoost (tuned)** was selected as the final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overfitting and Underfitting\n",
    "Learning curve analysis and cross-validation results show that the final model generalizes well.  \n",
    "No significant overfitting or underfitting was detected, and the model achieves a good bias–variance trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Files\n",
    "- `projet_lastf.ipynb` – Final notebook (data processing, modeling, evaluation)\n",
    "- `Rapport Machine Learning.pdf` – Project report\n",
    "- `requirements.txt` – Required Python libraries\n",
    "- `README.md` – Project overview\n",

    "## Installation and Execution\n",
    "To run the project:\n",
